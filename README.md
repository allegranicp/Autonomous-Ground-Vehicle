**Autonomous Vehicle Concept**

Overview
---
Small scale autonomous vehicle which combines sensor fusion, computer vision and artificial intelligence to perform obstacle avoidance, detection and localization.

* Built from a pre-fabricated chasis
* RPLIDAR and Pixy Cam are integrated with Raspberry PI Model B+ for object detection and localization
* Motor controllers are interfaced with Arduino Mega to control speed through PWM and PID
* ROS (Robotic Operating System) is used to broadcast and receive data from sensors for decision making
